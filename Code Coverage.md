**Overview Section**

Overall Code Coverage Percentage: A large, central gauge or progress bar showing the current overall code coverage percentage, aiming for a target (e.g., >80%) to ensure high-quality code.


**Detailed Metrics Section**

**Coverage by Type:**

- Line Coverage: A progress bar indicating the percentage of lines of code executed by tests.
- Branch Coverage: A chart showing the percentage of conditional branches covered by tests.
- Function Coverage: Visualized through a progress bar displaying the percentage of functions that have been tested.

Here are the progress bars for Line Coverage, Branch Coverage, and Function Coverage, visualized based on the specified percentages:

**Line Coverage** is shown at 75%, indicated with a green progress bar.

**Branch Coverage** is represented at 60%, depicted with an orange progress bar to signal moderate coverage.

**Function Coverage** appears at 80%, visualized with a blue progress bar, indicating a higher level of test coverage.

These visualizations provide a clear, at-a-glance view of the current state of code coverage in your project, aligning with the conceptual design of the information radiator for the "Just a Second Connector" project

**Real-Time Updates and Alerts**

1. **Live Feed:** A section dynamically updating in real-time with each push to the repository, reflecting changes in code coverage.
1. **Alerts:** Configurable alerts for when coverage falls below certain thresholds, prompting immediate attention.

**Project-Specific Features**

- **Database Interaction Coverage:** Given the upcoming work on database functionality, a dedicated section visualizes coverage of database interaction code, critical for the integrity of the matching system between job seekers and employers.
- **Admin Dashboard Development Coverage:** With the front-end team focusing on the admin dashboard, a specific visualization tracks the testing coverage of this new feature, ensuring all new functionalities are thoroughly tested.


This conceptual model of a code coverage information radiator combines comprehensive coverage tracking with interactive and collaborative features, tailored to the specific needs and upcoming challenges of the "Just a Second Connector" project. It's designed to promote a culture of quality and testing within the development team, ensuring the project meets its goals effectively.
