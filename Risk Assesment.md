**Information Radiator for Risk assessment and mitigation strategies**

**Risk Register:**

The risk register outlines various risks identified within the project. Firstly, the risk of hard coding the admin login without a signup page, assessed as medium likelihood and high impact, has been mitigated by implementing proper authentication mechanisms, marked as 'Done.' However, risks such as merging referral and questionnaire form databases, and creating a matching algorithm to connect job seekers with employers, are still in progress, requiring thorough testing and validation. Additionally, the dependency on third-party services for database storage and hosting, categorized as high likelihood and impact, is marked as 'Planned,' suggesting the need to identify backup solutions. Furthermore, the risk of insufficient resources allocated to the QA/testing phase remains unaddressed, indicating the necessity to allocate additional resources and time for thorough testing. Finally, the lack of documentation for system architecture and codebase, categorized as medium likelihood and impact, is also marked as 'Planned,' emphasizing the need to document these aspects thoroughly throughout development to mitigate potential issues. Overall, while some risks have been addressed, others are ongoing or yet to be tackled, highlighting the importance of continued risk management throughout the project lifecycle.


**Risk Heatmap:**

The risk heatmap provides a visual representation of the severity of identified risks within the project. Risks are categorized based on their likelihood and impact, resulting in a color-coded heatmap that highlights the severity levels. Risks such as hard coding the admin login without a signup page, creating a matching algorithm to connect job seekers with employers, and dependency on third-party services for database storage and hosting are classified as high severity (red), indicating their significant potential impact on the project. These risks require immediate attention and mitigation efforts to minimize their impact on project success. Risks such as merging referral and questionnaire form databases and insufficient resources allocated to the QA/testing phase are categorized as medium severity (yellow), signifying moderate potential impact. While these risks are not as critical as the high severity risks, they still pose a considerable threat to the project and should be addressed promptly. Finally, the lack of documentation for system architecture and codebase is classified as low severity (green), indicating a lower potential impact on the project. While still important, this risk may be addressed with less urgency compared to others. Overall, the risk heatmap offers a clear visual overview of the severity levels of identified risks, enabling stakeholders to prioritize and allocate resources effectively for risk management efforts.
