**Information Radiator for Resource allocation and budget tracking**
Designing an effective Information Radiator View for "Resource Allocation and Budget Tracking" in the context of the "Just a Second Connector" project involves creating a clear, easily understandable dashboard that highlights critical information at a glance. The design should be interactive where possible, allowing users to dive deeper into the data as needed.

The dashboard can be divided into several key sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of resource and budget tracking:
Budget Overview:

•	The pie chart visually represents the distribution of the project's budget across different categories.
•	Each slice of the pie represents a budget category, with the size of the slice proportional to the budget allocated to that category.
•	Labels on each slice indicate the category name, and the percentage value displays the proportion of the total budget allocated to that category.
•	The chart provides a quick and intuitive understanding of how resources are distributed across different aspects of the project, aiding in decision-making and resource management.
•	Overall, the pie chart effectively communicates the "Budget Overview" for the "Just a Second Connector" project, allowing stakeholders to grasp the allocation of resources at a glance.

Resource Allocation by Task:

•	The Gantt chart visually represents the project's resource allocation by task for the "Just a Second Connector" project.
•	Each horizontal bar corresponds to a specific task, with its length indicating the duration and its position on the timeline representing the start date.
•	Stakeholders can quickly understand the sequence of tasks, their durations, and their start dates at a glance.
•	The chart helps in identifying task dependencies and tracking progress, aiding in effective project planning and scheduling.
•	By providing a clear visualization of project timelines, the Gantt chart facilitates better decision-making and coordination among team members.
