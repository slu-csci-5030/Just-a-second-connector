Cumulative Flow Diagram serves as an effective information radiator, providing stakeholders with a clear and concise overview of the project's status,
progress, and potential areas of concern or risk. It can be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments and facilitate informed decision-making. Also, CFD
visualizes the workflow for a project to perform specific activities.
