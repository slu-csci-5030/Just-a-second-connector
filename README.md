**Introducing Just a Second Connector**
Welcome to Just a Second Connector, an innovative initiative launched by Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA). This platform is dedicated to addressing the distinct needs of individuals linked with the Criminal Justice system who are seeking employment opportunities. Just a Second Connector serves as a bridge, connecting these individuals with employers who are committed to offering a second chance.
At Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA), we recognize the importance of providing support and opportunities for those re-entering the workforce after involvement with the Criminal Justice system. Our platform aims to streamline this process, replacing the current reliance on Google Docs with a more efficient and tailored solution.

**How Just a Second Connector Works**
Just a Second Connector simplifies the job-seeking and employer matching process by providing a centralized platform. Here, job seekers can showcase their skills and experiences while employers can specify their requirements. Our platform then facilitates meaningful connections, ensuring a seamless and effective match between job seekers and employers.
Join us in our mission to create opportunities and foster positive change through Just a Second Connector. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of individuals seeking a fresh start in their professional journey.

**Referral Form:**
This form is used for referring or registering job seekers who are part of the target audience for the application's services.
•	It collects the information about jobseeker like name, email, phone number
•	It collects information about the referrer (name, organization, email) and their assessment of the job seeker's consistency and barriers to employment.
•	It asks about the job seeker's criminal convictions and the date of their most recent felony conviction.
•	It inquires if the job seeker is aware of being referred to the Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA) program.
•	It provides fields for the job seeker to introduce themselves and indicate any personal barriers or issues that might impact their job search.
•	It allows the job seeker to self-report potential charges that may come up during a background check.
•	It provides an optional field for additional information before pairing the job seeker with a job coach.
It is the comprehensive tool for gathering relevant details about both the referrer and the job seeker, including their background, barriers, and specific needs. This information will be used to match the job seeker with appropriate employment opportunities and support services.

**Admin Login**
This "Admin Login" button provides access to the administrative area of the application, which is reserved for authorized personnel only. The admin area allows you to perform advanced management tasks such as:
•	User administration (creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts)
•	Role and permission management
•	Viewing and analyzing application data and logs
•	Configuring application settings and preferences
•	Managing content and database entries

Only users with administrative privileges should access this area, as it grants elevated capabilities that could critically impact the application if misused. Proper credentials are required to log in to the admin area for security purposes.
Its primary goal is to help match job restrictions and requirements from both groups, facilitating employment opportunities for individuals involved with the criminal justice system.
In relation to the next module, we have to create the user interface that connects a coach and a job seeker by means of specific data.The questionnaire form must then be included so that the coach can send it to the job seekers.The jobseeker user interface, which will hold job applications, mentor details, and other information, must also be created. 
We also need to implement the section that says we have to pair companies with job seekers after submitting the candidates' videos to them. 
Run the backend code that controls user authentication, matching algorithms, and data storage. With regard to our project, we must devise a strategy for aligning the applicant's résumé with the employer's limitations on their criminal histories, among other aspects, such as educational background. 
To ensure that everything is operating as it should and that the result is what was expected, we also need to manually test the code. 
Furthermore, I believe that thorough system documentation is crucial, including technical documentation for developers and administrators as well as user guides.
