Just a Second Connector.
Hello there! Welcome to Just a Second Connector, a transformative project initiated by Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA). This platform addresses the unique needs of individuals associated with the Criminal Justice system seeking employment opportunities, connecting them with employers willing to provide a second chance. TWA currently relies on Google Docs to track both job seekers and employers, necessitating a more efficient system for matching the specific requirements of both groups. Just a Second Connector streamlines this process by providing a centralized platform for job seeker connections and employer matching. Our goal is to replace the existing Google Docs system, offering a comprehensive solution that facilitates the seamless tracking of progress for both job seekers and employers. Join us in this endeavor to make a positive impact and provide meaningful opportunities for those seeking a fresh start in the workforce.
Current Progress:
In our ongoing development of Just a Second Connector, we've achieved our first milestone, laying a foundation for the platform. The initial focus has been on user authentication, and we are proud to announce the successful implementation of a login and signup page. Using the power of React Testing Library, we tested the functionality to ensure everything is in place. The login and signup page enables users to register with the platform, employing validation checks for credentials to guarantee secure login procedures. Our testing suite encompasses various scenarios, including checking for the display of an alert in case of invalid credentials, handling both successful and unsuccessful login attempts, and verifying the proper storage of user data in local storage.
As part of this initial phase, we've prioritized foundational elements, with further features and functionalities in the pipeline. While more enhancements are on the horizon, this progress signifies a robust start toward the ultimate goal of connecting individuals involved with the Criminal Justice system to employment opportunities, fostering a supportive environment for both job seekers and compassionate employers. We encourage users, developers, and contributors to explore and test the existing functionalities, providing valuable feedback as we collectively shape the future of Just a Second Connector. Your engagement is crucial as we work towards creating a platform that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of the community. Thank you for being part of this transformative journey.
