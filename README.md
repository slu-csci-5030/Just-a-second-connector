Just a Second Connector. Hello there! Welcome to Just a Second Connector, a transformative project initiated by Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA). This platform addresses the unique needs of individuals associated with the Criminal Justice system seeking employment opportunities, connecting them with employers willing to provide a second chance. TWA currently relies on Google Docs to track both job seekers and employers, necessitating a more efficient system for matching the specific requirements of both groups. Just a Second Connector streamlines this process by providing a centralized platform for job seeker connections and employer matching. Our goal is to replace the existing Google Docs system, offering a comprehensive solution that facilitates the seamless tracking of progress for both job seekers and employers. Join us in this endeavor to make a positive impact and provide meaningful opportunities for those seeking a fresh start in the workforce. Current Progress: In our ongoing development of Just a Second Connector, we've achieved our first milestone, laying a foundation for the platform. The initial focus has been on user authentication, and we are proud to announce the successful implementation of a login and signup page. Using the power of React Testing Library, we tested the functionality to ensure everything is in place. The login and signup page enables users to register with the platform, employing validation checks for credentials to guarantee secure login procedures. Our testing suite encompasses various scenarios, including checking for the display of an alert in case of invalid credentials, handling both successful and unsuccessful login attempts, and verifying the proper storage of user data in local storage. As part of this initial phase, we've prioritized foundational elements, with further features and functionalities in the pipeline. While more enhancements are on the horizon, this progress signifies a robust start toward the ultimate goal of connecting individuals involved with the Criminal Justice system to employment opportunities, fostering a supportive environment for both job seekers and compassionate employers. We encourage users, developers, and contributors to explore and test the existing functionalities, providing valuable feedback as we collectively shape the future of Just a Second Connector. Your engagement is crucial as we work towards creating a platform that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of the community. Thank you for being part of this transformative journey. Installation: To experience the current progress locally, follow these steps: Clone the repository: https://github.com/slu-csci-5030/Just-a-second-connector.git Install dependencies: npm install Commands: To run the project: npm start For testing: npm test / npm run test

Tools: React

Create a reasonable unit test for a component in your system. Your unit test should: use the standard tooling your team has agreed on (33%), React
test some actual functionality for your system (33%), Check if the alert for invalid credentials is displayed Fill in the login form with invalid details Fill in the login form with valid details Fill in the registration form Check if the user data is appended to local storage

and run only the component without running the entire service or app (33%). We are running only the npm test to run our login page as well as the test cases In your submission Identify the testing framework your team has agreed on by name React testing library

Identify the requirement, as defined in a GitHub Issue, by linking to the relevant issue. Issues open and closed

Include instructions in the README or ContributorGuide for how to run the test without running the entire service or app. Instruction to run the test without running the main service: Command: npm run test

Purpose:
Just a Second Connector (JSC) is a transformative project initiated by the Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA) to address the unique needs of individuals associated with the criminal justice system seeking employment opportunities. The purpose of JSC is to provide a centralized platform that connects individuals with criminal justice involvement to compassionate employers willing to offer them a second chance. By facilitating these connections, JSC aims to promote the rehabilitation and successful reintegration of individuals into the workforce, ultimately reducing recidivism rates and fostering positive outcomes for both job seekers and employers.
Motive Behind the Initiative "Just a Second Connector (JSC)"
The primary motive behind the Just a Second Connector (JSC) initiative stems from the recognition of a critical need within the community of individuals associated with the Criminal Justice system. Many individuals who have interacted with the criminal justice system face significant barriers when seeking employment opportunities due to various factors, including stigma, lack of resources, and limited support networks. As a result, they often struggle to reintegrate into society and secure meaningful employment, which is essential for their successful rehabilitation and reintegration into the workforce.
The JSC initiative aims to address these challenges by providing a transformative platform that connects individuals with criminal justice involvement to employers who are willing to provide them with a second chance. By facilitating these connections, JSC seeks to create a supportive environment that promotes the rehabilitation and successful reintegration of individuals into the workforce, ultimately reducing recidivism rates and fostering positive outcomes for both job seekers and employers.
Approach to Tackling the Project
The project utilizes a systematic approach to tackle the challenges associated with connecting individuals involved with the criminal justice system to employment opportunities. The following strategies are employed:
Comprehensive Platform Development: JSC is developing a centralized platform that serves as a hub for job seekers and employers, providing a seamless and efficient mechanism for connecting the two groups. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, catering to the unique needs of individuals with criminal justice involvement and employers who are committed to providing them with opportunities.
User Authentication and Security: One of the initial focuses of the project is on user authentication and security. By implementing robust authentication mechanisms and employing validation checks for credentials, JSC ensures secure login procedures for both job seekers and employers. This includes rigorous testing of functionality to guarantee the proper handling of login attempts and the storage of user data in a secure manner.
Engagement and Collaboration: JSC actively engages with users, developers, and contributors to gather feedback and insights throughout the development process. By fostering a collaborative environment, the project ensures that the platform meets the needs and expectations of the community it serves. This engagement is essential for shaping the future direction of JSC and maximizing its impact.
Continuous Improvement and Enhancement: While laying the foundation for the platform is crucial, JSC recognizes that ongoing improvement and enhancement are necessary to meet the evolving needs of its users. Therefore, the project prioritizes continuous development and iteration, with plans to introduce additional features and functionalities in the future. This iterative approach ensures that JSC remains responsive to the needs of its stakeholders and continues to deliver value over time.
