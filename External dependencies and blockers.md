Just a second chance project has some External dependencies and Blockers that we faced during our project. We have provided the solution to these issues. These are some, 

**External Dependencies:**

1. Stakeholder Dependencies: Projects may be been depended on external actions or decisions be stakeholders outside the project team. Lack of prompt response on the part of the organizations issuing required documents and decisions may prevent a smooth progress.

2. Third-party Integration: Projects that join with other (third-party) systems or platforms might confront problems if their (third-party) platforms meet with any delays, issues or changes at the same time.

3. Technology Dependencies: Unexpected problems in the efficiency of technology that deals with specific tools and technologies, for example, it comes to software bugs, compatibility issues with the hardware or fault of that.

4. Community Support and Partnerships: Creating ties with the local community, employers, and key partners is indeed a significant step as a supportive infrastructure is created for the program participants.



**Blockers:**

1. Technology Infrastructure:The question is whether affected by poor connectivity and small technological infrastructure or not may raise problems specially concerning the participants who are socially disadvantaged or rural inhabitants with weak technological base.

2. Security and Data Privacy: Sensitive personal data management as well as the provision of security and privacy of participant data are two elements that are of the highest priority need and must have the crucial measures to prevent any leaks or unauthorized accesses.

3. Employment Opportunities: Providing access to full employment for these participants could be hampered by the existence of handicaps like educational background shortcomings, no job skill set, and reluctance of employers to hire former convicts.

4. Community Support and Acceptance: Community acceptance for the project's purposes might be easy, but the acceptance of the population served by the project may be difficult to achieve. The task of establishing a positive relationship with the community includes public relations and outreach initiatives.

5. Quality Issues: The quality of deliverables in the project could be driven either from internal processes or items from external suppliers. This could bring in rework, which might translate into delay in project timelines.

6. Lack of Expertise: If the project includes the skills or knowledge, not acquired in direct set up by the team members is high, then the chance of the project to be delayed or error prone drastically increases.

7. Communication Breakdowns: Conflicts of ideas, disposition or customs among group members, stakeholders, and external partners may result in lack of understanding of mistakes and delayed decision-making acting as stepping stones to requests.

8. Risk Events: In addition to this, we must not take into account the unexpected occurrences such as climate change, political conflicts or cyber attacks among others that can negatively impact the project activities and throw timelines out of gear if not promptly handled.
