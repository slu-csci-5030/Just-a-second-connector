**Information Radiator for Upcoming milestones and deadlines**

The "Upcoming Milestones and Deadlines" Information Radiator offers a concise overview of critical project phases, deadlines, and their current status. It enables the team to prioritize tasks, allocate resources efficiently, and stay on track with the project timeline. By providing a visual representation of upcoming milestones, this tool promotes transparency, fosters communication, and encourages accountability within the team, all essential for the successful execution of the "Just a Second Connector" project.

How It Works
Milestone Overview: Each milestone represents a significant phase or deliverable in the project, such as completing database integrations, launching the admin dashboard, or implementing key functionalities like automatic updates for job seeker listings.
Deadlines and Countdowns: Deadlines are set for each milestone, with countdowns providing a visual cue to the urgency and time frame for completion, fostering a sense of urgency and helping with prioritization.
Status Tracking: The current progress of each milestone is tracked (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed), offering immediate insight into the project's progress and highlighting any areas that may require additional focus or resources.
Responsibility Assignment: Assigning team members or sub-teams to each task ensures clarity in roles and responsibilities, promoting accountability within the team.
Priority Indication: By assigning priority levels to tasks, the team can quickly identify what needs immediate attention, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to meet the most critical deadlines.
