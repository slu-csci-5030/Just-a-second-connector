**Information Radiator for User story mapping**
User Stories:
Key Components:
•	User Stories: Descriptions of particular features or functionalities from various user perspectives.
•	Description: Concise explanations of each user story to offer context and clarity.
•	Acceptance Criteria: Conditions that must be fulfilled for the user story to be deemed complete and satisfactory.
•	Priority: Degree of significance or urgency attributed to each user story to direct development and release scheduling.
•	Status: Present condition or progress of each user story, denoting whether it's in backlog, in progress, or completed.

In this above layout:
•	Each row represents a user story.
•	Columns include:
User Story: Unique identifier for the user story.
Description: Brief description of the user story.
Acceptance Criteria: Criteria that must be met for the user story to be considered complete.
Priority: Level of priority assigned to the user story.
Status: Current status of the user story (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
•	Color-coded labels or tags can be added to indicate priority levels (e.g., High: Red, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green) and status (e.g., To Do: Blue, In Progress: Orange, Done: Green).
	This layout provides a clear and organized view of user stories, their descriptions, acceptance criteria, priorities, and statuses, allowing the development team to track progress and prioritize tasks effectively.

Progress and Predict completion through User Stories:

•	The x-axis of the chart represents the number of days elapsed during the project, while the y-axis represents the number of user stories remaining to be completed.
•	Two lines are plotted on the chart: the "Planned Trajectory" and the "Actual Trajectory."
•	The "Planned Trajectory" line indicates the expected rate of work completion, with a planned decrease in the number of user stories over time.
•	Similarly, the "Actual Trajectory" line represents the actual rate of work completion based on real-time data, showing the actual number of user stories remaining over time.
•	By comparing the two trajectories, teams can identify any deviations from the planned rate of work completion, helping them understand if they are on track or if adjustments need to be made.
•	The gap between the "Planned Trajectory" and "Actual Trajectory" lines indicates deviations from the planned rate of work completion.
•	The markers (circles for planned trajectory, crosses for actual trajectory) on the lines represent data points, showing the number of user stories remaining at specific days.
•	Overall, the burndown chart provides a visual representation of the team's progress towards completing user stories over time, enabling them to track progress and predict project completion.
