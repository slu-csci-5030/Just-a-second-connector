For the "Just a Second Connector" project, the **team's celebrations and recognitions** component of the information radiator can highlight and showcase the team's achievements, milestones, and individual contributions. This component can help foster a positive and collaborative environment by acknowledging and celebrating successes, as well as recognizing the hard work and dedication of team members.


Words of Encouragement: 
"Great job, team! Your hard work and dedication are truly inspiring." "Keep up the fantastic work, and remember to celebrate your wins along the way."
