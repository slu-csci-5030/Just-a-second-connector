**Tasks Completed:**
**Front-end:**
Our team has successfully completed the initial phase of our project, culminating in the development of a fully functional landing page. The landing page features essential navigation elements, including a prominently placed Home button, ensuring easy access to project-related information.
Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated a referral form into the landing page. This form is designed to gather basic information from jobseekers referred by users. It includes pertinent questions tailored to the jobseeker's profile, facilitating efficient referral management.
In addition to the referral form, we have also finalized the questionnaires intended for coach-jobseeker interactions. These questionnaires, though currently hidden, will be accessible to coaches upon successful matching with a jobseeker. This feature streamlines the process of gathering relevant information from jobseekers to enhance coaching interactions.
Moreover, we have implemented an Employer registration form, strategically incorporating fields such as company name and job-related inquiries. This form aims to simplify the onboarding process for employers interested in our platform, ensuring seamless user engagement.
Lastly, we have developed an administrative login page equipped with secure access controls. Accessible only to authorized personnel via unique username and password credentials, this feature safeguards sensitive administrative functionalities.  

**Back-end:**
Our team worked on storing the data from the referral form into database.As for this part, we have tried working with Mongo db and postgres sql, to check which is more efficient.As for the upcoming tasks we will decide on one platform to work with based on efficiency.
Our exploration involved comprehensive testing of both database management systems to assess their suitability for our project's requirements. Through rigorous evaluation, we aimed to identify the platform that offers optimal performance and scalability for storing and managing our data effectively.

**Tasks ongoing:**
**Front-end:**
Our team is diligently working on crafting an intuitive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly connects jobseekers with coaches and employers. This interface will serve as a vital component in facilitating meaningful connections and interactions within our platform. We are committed to ensuring that the user experience is optimized for efficiency and satisfaction.
And created hard-coded admin dashboard and present working on it that displays the real content like buttons with match jobseeker with coach and employer, job coaches and jobseekers info etc.
   
**Back-end:**
As for back end, one team is working on storing the data collected from questionaries form in to database which is local host and other team is working on storing the information from the referral form and questionaries form into database combinedly by merging the each jobseeker data in a single row.


**Tasks to complete:**

We need to implement the section that says we have to pair companies with job seekers after submitting the candidates' videos to them.
Run the backend code that controls user authentication, matching algorithms, and data storage.
With regard to our project, we must devise a strategy for aligning the applicant's résumé with the employer's limitations on their criminal histories, among other aspects, such as educational background.
To ensure that everything is operating as it should and that the result is what was expected, we also need to manually test the code.
Furthermore, I believe that thorough system documentation is crucial, including technical documentation for developers and administrators as well as user guides.
