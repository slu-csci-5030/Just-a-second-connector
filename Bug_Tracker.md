JUST A SECOND CONNECTOR We have divided 20 important components needed for our project among our team members and equally contributed towards all the metrics needed for the information radiator.

Incident and bug tracking:
	To deal with faults and bugs reported within the Just a Second connector (JSC) project in focus, a systemic approach must be used for purposes of transparency, efficiency and accountability. Here's a future structured plan:
Selection of Tracking Tool: Identify an appropriate issue tracking tool from a range of options, including Jira, Trello, Asana, etc., or GitHub Issues. Take into account the variables like team familiarity, integration potential, and the ability to scale.
Establishing Categories: Identify categories for incidents and bugs considering their severity and impact on project completion measures.Common categories include:
Critical: Issues that cause crucial dysfunction and take up hazardous risks.
Major: Problems that target crucial parts or the usability of the product.
Minor: Non-critical issues and other enhancements which can be revisited at a later time.
Creation of Reporting Channels: Categorize defect tracking to enable dedicated reporting channels and repositories in the tracking tool that has been selected. This can be achieved by setting up channels or repositories for reporting bugs and issues. Provide access to every team member and stakeholder belonging to the project by any and all means needed.
Clear Reporting Guidelines: Elaborate on the reporting procedures that should be followed after the occurrence of incidents and bugs.
Assigned Responsibility: Provide the function of screening, prioritizing, and solving reported errors and bugs. Assign tasks to a particular member of the team or a specific role (project manager or developer) for each task.
Prioritization Criteria: Specify an algorithm to prioritize incidents and bugs on the base of:
Consequence on project goals and objectives.
Severity and urgency.
Stakeholder and user feedback.
Regular Review and Updates: Schedule regular meetings or appointments to discuss the list of incidents and bugs, prioritize them according to the certain criteria, and assign to the relevant team member for its solution.
Communication Protocol: Develop an appropriate communication protocol that informs stakeholders and your team members on the status of reported incidents and bugs. Provide progress updates twice a month, and give solutions and alternatives when they are required.
Documentation and Tracking: Keep track of all reported incidents and bugs in the corresponding tool, specifying status, responsible person, and details related to issues solved. Make a detailed record so that it can be used in future when you may have to conduct a review.
Continuous Improvement: Implement prevention and corrective measures through reviewing incidents to find the root causes of those. Apply the obtained data to improve processes further and to increase the quality of the project. Use our AI-powered essay writing tool to create impressive college application essays that stand out.

Here are some incidents that could occur specifically within the Just a Second Connector:

Critical Incident: Server Downtime
Description: The JSC platform experiences unexpected server downtime, rendering it inaccessible to all users.
Impact: Users are unable to access the platform to search for job opportunities or connect with employers, leading to potential missed opportunities for employment.
Priority: Critical
Assigned Personnel: System Administrator
Resolution: System Administrator Team to identify the cause of downtime (e.g., server overload, network issues) and work quickly to restore server functionality to minimize service disruption.


Minor Incident: Broken Link in Email Notifications
Description: Users report that some links included in email notifications sent by the JSC platform are broken or lead to incorrect pages.
Impact: Users may experience inconvenience when trying to access relevant content or updates from the platform.
Priority: Minor
Assigned Personnel: QA Team, Frontend Developer
Resolution: QA Team to verify reported broken links and document specific instances. Frontend Developer to fix broken links in email templates and ensure proper URL redirection to the intended pages.






Major Incident: Data Loss
Description: A technical error or system glitch results in the loss of user data stored on the JSC platform, including profiles, resumes, and job preferences.
Impact: Users may lose valuable information and progress made in their job search efforts, leading to frustration and loss of trust in the platform.
Priority: Major
Assigned Personnel: Database Administrator, Development Team
Resolution: Database Administrator to investigate the cause of data loss and attempt to recover any lost data from backups. Development Team to implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as regular database backups and data integrity checks.


Critical Incident: Security Breach
Description: An unauthorized individual gains access to user accounts or sensitive information stored on the JSC platform due to a security vulnerability.
Impact: Compromise of user privacy and confidentiality, leading to potential legal and reputational consequences for the platform.
Priority: Critical
Assigned Personnel: Security Team, Development Team
Resolution: Security Team to conduct a thorough security audit to identify and patch any vulnerabilities exploited by the breach. Development Team to assist in implementing security patches and reinforcing security measures, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to prevent future breaches.


Major Incident: Performance Degradation During Peak Hours
Description: Users experience slow loading times and performance issues while using the JSC platform, particularly during peak usage hours.
Impact: Reduced user satisfaction and engagement, potentially leading to decreased usage and adoption of the platform.
Priority: Major
Assigned Personnel: DevOps Team, Backend Developers
Resolution: DevOps Team to conduct performance monitoring and optimization of server resources to handle increased traffic during peak hours. Backend Developers to optimize database queries and application code to improve overall platform performance and responsiveness.
